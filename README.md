# HomeworkIntroduction
This is a Github Introduction Homework. I'm learning the basics of Github by navigating different sections

I am guiding myself around github for basic knowledge. 
I've learned that the Code tab is for implementing files, I'm understand that the Issues tab is to resolve errors. if im not mistaken the pull request is linked with issues because its request to fix errors.
I figured that Actions tabs is just add-ons to make managment with codding better
I beliveve that insight is status for every categorized activity.
When learning about multiple things in Github I realized that it's easy to understand the concept of anything once interacted with in github.
